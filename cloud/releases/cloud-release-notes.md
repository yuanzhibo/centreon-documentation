### Centreon IT Edition

- **More configuration options for hosts and services**:

   When configuring your hosts and services, you can now configure the interval between checks, both when the resource is OK and when validating a non-OK state. You can also configure the number of checks needed to validate a non-OK state before triggering an alert.
Finally, you can also assign your resources with specific icons to improve the readability of the interface. 

- **Dashboards Beta**:

   We keep improving our new proposition for creating and sharing intuitive dashboards effortlessly! With this release you can benefit from multiple improvements (with the selection of resources, with the look and feel of graphs...), from a new widget named "Status grid", and from bug fixes.

### Centreon IT Edition

* **New notification configuration system**:

   You can now configure notifications on a per user and per resource basis.
Associate users with resources and the statuses for which users will be notified, define a notification format, and tailor notifications according to your users' scope of monitoring. Only email notifications are available now (more to come).

* **Resources Status**:

   - In addition to the current view (**All** view), you can now access to two new views to see only the services (**By Services** view), as well as a view to see the hosts and all their attached services (**By Hosts** view).
   - We have also completely redesigned filters, making it easier to select resources.

* **Dashboards Beta**:

   With Dashboards, you can effortlessly create and share intuitive dashboards for real-time monitoring of metrics, host/service statuses, and much more. Join our [Dashboards Beta group](https://thewatch.centreon.com/groups/centreon-dashboards-beta-59) on our community platform The Watch!

* **HTTPS connection between central and poller**:

   Communication between the central server and the pollers is now done using HTTPS instead of going through Centreon's VPN.
